##No Scope Detector Plugin for CSGO
Prints a message to the chat to all players that the player has noscoped a player. In order to tweak it, you need to edit the source code, no configs right now

##Installation
Just copy the files and paste them. EZZZZ!!

Disclaimer: I know programming but I doesn't know SourcePawn (the language of csgo plugins). I just made this plugin from seeing codes from other sources. Tweaked them according to my needs. At last, it does the job.

Pull Requests are welcome but I will only merge them when I understand them. Sorry for being like that. Happy Coding :)
